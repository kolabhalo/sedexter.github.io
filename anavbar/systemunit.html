        <ul>
            <li>Processing Power</li>
            <br>
            <dd>The CPU is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It handles tasks such as arithmetic operations, logic operations, and controlling the flow of data within the computer.</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Memory Management</li>
            <br>
            <dd>The system unit contains RAM (Random Access Memory), which provides temporary storage for data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly. RAM allows for fast read and write operations, enhancing overall system performance.</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Data Storage</li>
            <br>
            <dd>While the system unit itself doesn't typically store large amounts of data, it contains interfaces and connections for various storage devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and optical drives. These storage devices hold the operating system, applications, files, and other data.</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Expansion Slots</li>
            <br>
            <dd>Many system units include expansion slots for adding additional components such as graphics cards, sound cards, network interface cards, and other peripherals. This allows users to customize and upgrade their systems to meet specific needs, such as gaming, multimedia editing, or networking.</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Power Supply</li>
            <br>
            <dd>The system unit houses the power supply unit (PSU), which converts AC power from the wall outlet into DC power that the computer components can use. The PSU distributes power to the various components within the system unit and peripherals connected to the computer.</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Cooling</li>
            <br>
            <dd>Modern system units often include fans or other cooling mechanisms to dissipate heat generated by the CPU, GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), and other components. Proper cooling is essential for maintaining optimal performance and preventing overheating, which can damage components.</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Connectivity</li>
            <br>
            <dd>The system unit contains ports and connectors for connecting external devices such as monitors, keyboards, mice, printers, USB drives, and networking equipment. These connections enable communication between the computer and external devices.</dd>
