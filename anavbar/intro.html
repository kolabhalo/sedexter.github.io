      <h1>How Computer Systems Work</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Computer systems are complex devices comprising numerous hardware and software parts that cooperate in carrying out tasks. The Central Processing Unit (CPU) connects with other parts of the computer, including memory and input/output devices, after retrieving instructions from memory, decoding them, and carrying out the required tasks.

        Memory, commonly referred to as RAM, is a short-term storage space for the CPU that keeps information and commands it needs to retrieve quickly. Storage devices like hard and solid-state drives offer long-term data and file storage. Users can enter information and commands into the computer using input devices like keyboards and Mouse, while output devices like monitors and printers display or print the computer's calculations.
        
        The motherboard links all the computer parts together and enables communication between them. All of the computer's components are powered by the power supply unit. Fans of liquid cooling are examples of cooling systems that avoid overheating and hardware damage. The computer's Network Interface Card (NIC) links it to a network and enables communication with other hardware.
        
        Peripherals are extra devices that can be connected to a computer to increase its functionality. The operating system (OS) regulates how the computer interacts with input/output devices, memory, and storage and manages the computer's hardware and software resources. It also handles how the computer communicates with other networked devices. Drivers are specialized software programs that enable the operating system to communicate with hardware components, whereas applications are the specific tools that users use to carry out tasks.</p>

    <h1>What is Computer Software?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Software refers to the programs and instructions that tell the hardware what to do. This includes the operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux), which manages the computer's resources and provides a user interface, as well as application software (e.g., word processors, web browsers, games) that perform specific tasks.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Futhermore, software serves as the intangible soul of the computer system, empowering it with functionality and intelligence. Operating systems, like Windows, macOS, and Linux, act as the intermediary between the hardware and the user, managing system resources and providing a platform for running applications. Application software spans a wide spectrum, ranging from productivity tools like word processors and spreadsheets to entertainment software such as games and media players, catering to diverse user needs and preferences.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="center">
    <h1>What is Computer Hardware?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>This includes all the physical components of the computer system, such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage devices (hard drives, solid-state drives), input devices (keyboard, mouse), output devices (monitor, printer), and other peripheral devices.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The hardware forms the tangible foundation of a computer system, encompassing the physical components that facilitate computation and data processing. Central to this is the central processing unit (CPU), often referred to as the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations at breathtaking speeds. Alongside the CPU, memory modules such as RAM (Random Access Memory) provide swift access to data and instructions for immediate processing, while storage devices such as hard drives and solid-state drives store vast amounts of data for long-term retention.</p>
